# üìò GridMaster Version History

---
## v0.3.2 - 2025-05-04
‚ú® Updates
	‚Ä¢	[multi_stage_search]
	‚Ä¢	Updated multi_stage_search() to default to searching all initialized models when no model_name is specified.
		Users can still explicitly pass a subset of model names if they want to tune only specific models.
	‚Ä¢	[Documentation Improvements]
	‚Ä¢	Added a prerequisite warning in the fine_search() section to clarify that it requires prior execution of coarse_search().
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced the Quick Start guide to highlight the difference in scope:
	‚Ä¢	coarse_search() and fine_search() always run across all initialized models.
	‚Ä¢	multi_stage_search() allows targeting specific models or defaulting to all.

## v0.3.1 ‚Äì 2025-05-02 Bugfixes & Usability Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Fixed stage naming in reports (removed raw stage1 suffix).
	‚Ä¢	Improved fallback when fine grids are too narrow or degenerate.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced user tips and warning messages for clearer guidance.
	‚Ä¢	Report generation now skips models without valid search results.
	‚Ä¢	Polished docstrings, outputs, and internal messages for consistency.

## v0.3.0 ‚Äì 2025-05-02 Smart Fine-Tuning & Multi-Stage Upgrade
	‚Ä¢	Added smart, expert, custom modes to fine_search and multi_stage_search.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented _identify_important_params for automatic selection of key tuning parameters.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced auto_generate_fine_grid() to handle parameter constraints and fallback safely.
	‚Ä¢	Added custom_estimator_params interface for injecting model-specific (e.g., GPU) arguments.
	‚Ä¢	Improved logging with clear stage names, icons (üîç, üîß), and better readability.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced final report: now summarizes stage-by-stage best parameters and overall best model.

## v0.2.2 ‚Äì 2025-05-02 Advanced Parameters Added
	‚Ä¢	Exposed n_jobs, verbose, refit, return_train_score as configurable arguments.
	‚Ä¢	Passed these into all GridSearchCV calls to enable advanced parallelism and control.
	‚Ä¢	Updated docstrings for clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Fully backward-compatible.

## v0.2.1 - 2025-05-01

‚ú® New
	‚Ä¢	Added a comprehensive MkDocs-powered user manual with quickstart guide, API reference, and advanced utilities.
	‚Ä¢	Integrated ReadTheDocs deployment for online documentation access.

üõ† Fixed
	‚Ä¢	Updated contact email in setup.py and all documentation files to replace the old GitHub noreply address.
	‚Ä¢	Minor corrections to documentation formatting and navigation.


## v0.2.0 ‚Äì 2025-05-01

‚ú® **Functionality Enhancements**
- Improved `auto_generate_fine_grid()` with support for log-scale parameters; parameters like `C`, `learning_rate`, etc. are now interpolated logarithmically where appropriate.
- Added fine-grained control over all plotting functions (`plot_cv_score_curve`, `plot_confusion_matrix`, etc.) via new optional arguments (e.g., `title_fontsize`, `label_fontsize`, `figsize`, etc.).

üé® **Visualization Improvements**
- Optimized default font sizes for high-resolution (HiDPI/Retina) displays, ensuring clearer axis labels and titles.
- Introduced a global font control mechanism for plots, allowing users to easily standardize typography across all visualizations.

üßæ **Backward Compatibility**
- All new features are fully backward compatible and optional.

## v0.1.1 ‚Äì 2025-04-30

- Added detailed docstrings and descriptions for all methods
- Improved `demo_usage.ipynb` with clearer outputs and warnings filtered
- Cleaned terminal output, removed redundant `utils.py`
- Refactored verbosity control for LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost
- Enhanced export functionality with timestamped folders
- Ready for second PyPI release
